# Assertgen

## _Command-Line Interface (CLI)_ to token generation

Assertgen is a CLI prototype for PocLib, that can perform different tasks using the proposed token nested model. It was developed during Phase 2 of HPE/USP Transitive Identity & Embedded Claims project to support the specification and test of the proposed solution. Considering this, new features were constantly being added throughout the project.

It main features can be grouped as follows:

- General functions
-  Asserting Workload Interactions
-  ECDSA token creation and validation
-  Standard Schnorr token creation and validation
-  Concatenated Schnorr token creation and validation
-  Standard tracing model (poc scenario)
-  Selector-based assertion (poc scenario)

### General functions

`./assergen help`
|Parameter|Type|Required|Description|
|--|--|--|--|
|`help`|string|yes|Return a list of parameters and their descriptions|

`./assergen print <token>`
|Parameter|Type|Required|Description|
|--|--|--|--|
|`<token>`|string|yes|Print given base64 nested token payloads and signatures|

### Asserting Workload Interactions

The asserting workload is a specifically designed Identity Provider (IdP) to mint, validate, and generate a more restricted token and ZKP based in a valid OKTA OAuth token. The PoC documentation can provide details about asserting workload construction and functionalities.
Assertgen can interact with a running instance of [asserting-wl](link_to_PoC_md_file) (IdP developed in PoC). To be able to interact with asserting-wl using spiffe-mTLS, it is necessary a running spire server/agent in the environment and a registration entry in SPIRE associated to the user that will execute the client. Eg:

```console
spire-server entry create \
    -parentID spiffe://example.org/host \
    -spiffeID spiffe://example.org/myuser \
    -selector unix:user:myuser
```


After that, its endpoints are acessible through assertgen, using the following commands:
